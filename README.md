## Inspiration
With the growing number of brilliant minds forgoing academia in search for more sustainable options, our knowledge and curiosity are cast aside in our society. We aim to strike a balance between money and research to reincentivize researching while making a monetarily sustainable path those pursuing academia.
## What it does
Our project, Indicium, is a one-stop shop web application for selling and buying research papers. Unlike a journal, authors can upload their research to our website, and will recieve 
## How we built it
We built our webapp using a JavaScript + React frontend and a Python + Flask backend. Furthermore, we hosted our application as well as a database using GCP.
## Challenges we ran into
When coming up with our idea, we realized that piracy exists in the imperfect world we are in today. Although we cannot solve piracy as a whole, we can certainly do what we can to provide authors a better solution for their papers than journals.

## What we learned
Arjun: Through working on this project, I learned how to create a React + Flask app using a REST API. Furthermore, I learned how to host our project and database on GCP, which was a fairly simple process (Thanks Google Cloud!). Lastly, I learned a little more about developing algorithms in Python, as well as hashing functions using hashlib for Python3.

## What's next for Indicium
Although some advanced key features of our project are not completely polished, we believe that Indicium has a place in the future of research. We wish to host our application as well as attempt to make a business model for earning a small amount of revenue from our application.
